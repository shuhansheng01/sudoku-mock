## Overview
This project is a static mock website of the game Sudoku, built entirely with **HTML and CSS** (no JavaScript).  
It shows what a Sudoku game page might look like in progress and serves as a base for future interactive versions.

The design uses a **soft natural theme** with mint green and warm beige tones to create a calm and simple interface.  
I focused on clean layout, consistent spacing, and mobile responsiveness.

## Pages
- **Home Page:** Game title and navigation buttons.  
- **Selection Page:** List of fictional Sudoku games and authors.  
- **Hard Game (9×9):** Sudoku grid made with CSS Grid, with a fake timer.  
- **Easy Game (6×6):** Smaller grid using the same structure.  
- **Rules Page:** Basic game rules and a “Made by” section with my contact links.  
- **High Scores Page:** Mock leaderboard using an HTML table.  
- **Login / Register Pages:** Simple forms with username and password inputs.

## Navbar & Layout
- The navbar stays fixed when scrolling and highlights the active page.  
- Uses flexbox and grid for layout.  
- On small screens (like iPhone 12), the navbar moves to the bottom for better usability.

## HTML & CSS Features Used
- **HTML elements:** div, span, a, img, p, head, button, input, h1–h3, ul, ol, table  
- **CSS properties:** font-family, background, margin, padding, position, flex, grid, text-align, @media queries  
- **Pseudo-classes:** :hover, :focus  
- **Transitions:** Used for button and link hover effects  
- No frameworks or libraries were used.

## Design Notes
I wanted the site to feel light and friendly, so I chose rounded fonts (*Quicksand* and *M PLUS Rounded 1c*) and soft colors.  
I also made sure each page looks consistent and the Sudoku grids are centered and visually balanced.

## Reflection
**Most challenging part:**  
Creating the 9×9 grid with pure CSS and aligning all borders correctly took the most time.

**Mobile-friendly decisions:**  
I used media queries to resize fonts, center elements, and move the navbar for small screens.

**Proud of:**  
The clean layout and cohesive color theme. Everything feels simple and organized.

**If I had more time:**  
I would add JavaScript logic for Sudoku validation, a working timer, and user score storage.

**Time spent:** About 10 hours total.
